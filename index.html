											<h2>Background</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Self-rated poverty is a widely used social indicator that reflects individuals' perceptions 
										of their economic status. Unlike objective poverty measures based on income or consumption, 
										self-rated poverty captures how people subjectively assess their well-being in relation to their 
										socioeconomic environment. This perception is influenced by various factors, including economic 
										conditions, inflation, employment opportunities, social policies, and cultural expectations.
										<br><br>
										In the Philippines (or any country of focus), self-rated poverty has been monitored through 
										surveys since 1983, providing valuable insights into how individuals perceive their economic 
										situation over time. The dataset covering self-rated poverty from 1983 to 2025 presents 
										an opportunity to analyze long-term trends and examine how economic and social changes have 
										influenced people's perceptions of poverty.</p>

											<p>The surveys conducted by Social Weather Stations (SWS) are based on rigorous methodologies to ensure accuracy and reliability. Below are the key aspects of the methodology:</p>
											<div class="overview-cards">
												<div class="overview-card">
													<h4><strong>Sampling</strong></h4>
													<p>The surveys use a stratified random sampling method to ensure representation across different regions, socioeconomic classes, and demographics.</p>
												</div>
												<div class="overview-card">
													<h4><strong>Survey Instrument</strong></h4>
													<p>Respondents are asked a standardized question: "Where would you place your family in terms of poverty: poor, borderline, or not poor?"</p>
												</div>
												<div class="overview-card">
													<h4><strong>Frequency</strong></h4>
													<p>Surveys are conducted quarterly, providing a consistent and up-to-date measure of self-rated poverty.</p>
												</div>
												<div class="overview-card">
													<h4><strong>Data Collection</strong></h4>
													<p>Interviews are conducted face-to-face by trained field personnel to minimize response bias and ensure clarity.</p>
												</div>
												<div class="overview-card">
													<h4><strong>Sample Size</strong></h4>
													<p>Each survey typically includes 1,200 respondents, with a margin of error of ±3% at the national level.</p>
												</div>
												<div class="overview-card">
													<h4><strong>Scope</strong></h4>
													<p>The surveys cover the entire Philippines, with four major geographic areas: National Capital Region (NCR), Balance Luzon (outside NCR), Visayas, and Mindanao. </p>
												</div>
											</div>
											<br/>
											<p>This methodology ensures that the data collected reflects the perceptions of a diverse cross-section of the population, making it a valuable tool for understanding poverty trends in the Philippines.</p>

								    <h2>Graph Interpretation</h2>
								    <p>
								        The self-rated poverty trends from <strong>1985 to 2025</strong> reveal a persistent <strong>high percentage of Filipinos considering themselves poor</strong>. 
								        The "Poor" category has dominated, fluctuating mostly between <strong>50% and 70%</strong>, while the "Borderline" and "Not Poor" groups remain significantly lower. 
								    </p>
								    <p>
								        Various historical events, such as <strong>economic crises, political transitions, and natural disasters</strong>, have directly influenced poverty perception. 
								        Major spikes align with <strong>economic downturns, inflation, and political instability</strong>, while brief declines reflect <strong>economic growth and reforms</strong>.

											<div class="contentcollapse">
												<p>The data collected from Social Weather Stations (SWS) was organized into a structured table with five columns: year, month, poor, borderline, and not poor. The first two columns represent the time period of each survey, while the last three contain the percentage of respondents who self-rated themselves as poor, borderline, or not poor. This format allowed for easy identification of trends and patterns over time.</p>
											</div>

											<button class="collapsible" style="width: max-content;">Standarization</button>
											<div class="contentcollapse">
												<p>Data cleaning involved handling missing values, removing duplicates, and ensuring consistency in the dataset. Missing values were imputed using statistical methods, and outliers were identified and addressed to ensure the accuracy of the analysis.</p>	
												<p>Data standardization was performed to ensure that all variables were on the same scale. This was particularly important for the analysis of self-rated poverty. For proper scaling, max survey data was limited to the minimum amount of respondents on the SWS surveys.</p>

									<h2>Conclusion</h2>
									<p>The analysis of self-rated poverty trends in the Philippines from 1985 to 2025 highlights significant shifts in the socio-economic landscape, revealing both periods of progress and setbacks. By leveraging the detailed SWS survey data, we observed the following key insights:</p>
								</header>
							
								<ol class="justified-list">
                                    <li><strong>Persistent Challenges in Poverty – </strong> Despite various economic policies and interventions over the years, self-rated poverty remains a persistent issue for a large portion of the Filipino population. Economic growth has not consistently translated into meaningful improvements in the living conditions of the most vulnerable.</li>
                                    <li><strong>The Impact of Political and Economic Events – </strong> Major political and economic events, such as global crises and local policy shifts, correlate strongly with fluctuations in self-rated poverty. The data suggests that certain administrations were more successful than others in addressing poverty, but the overall trend shows that poverty alleviation remains a complex, long-term challenge.</li>
                                    <li><strong>The Role of Government Initiatives – </strong> Government programs aimed at poverty reduction have had varying degrees of success. While some initiatives led to short-term improvements, the sustained reduction of self-rated poverty requires comprehensive, systemic reforms that go beyond temporary aid.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Need for Long-Term Structural Change – </strong> The findings suggest that, while short-term solutions may alleviate the symptoms of poverty, true progress can only be achieved through long-term structural reforms in education, healthcare, employment, and governance. The data underscores the importance of focusing on equitable economic growth and inclusive development policies.</li>
									<li><strong>Slow Downward Trend – </strong> Without detracting from the insights shared in the preceding sections, there is a slow downward trend in the number of people reporting that they are poor, and a gradual upward trend in those reporting that they are not poor. As we have noted, while there have been short-term fluctuations, the overall trend remains downward. However, this slow downward trend over the decades does not seem to align with the rapid economic growth the country has experienced in the same period. Thus, we can surmise that while the nation has seen economic growth, the benefits of this growth have been slow to reach the Filipino masses.</li>
								</ol>
								
								<p>In conclusion, while the Philippines has made some strides toward improving its poverty situation, there is much work to be done. The persistence of high levels of self-rated poverty underscores the need for more effective, comprehensive, and inclusive poverty reduction strategies that address the root causes of inequality and improve the quality of life for all Filipinos.</p>
